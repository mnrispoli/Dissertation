%Comment about how the people in lab you end up spending more time with than your loved ones.
%
%Eric, how to create -- like really create. an attention to detail and care in fabrication I'll never be able to obtain. Patience to listen to my ideas and work through problems from a fundamental place and support in going to the gym, cycling, and getting a job. Taiwan and Singapore
%
%Alex, how to destroy -- the beautify of MBL, the fine line between being stubborn and persistent, a high-standard of doing what you think is right -- whether I always agreed with it or not
%
%Adam, superstar organized postdoc who became more than a mentor as a friend.  Not to mention your better half Annalise.
%
%Rajibul, how to be involved and willingness to work with me and help me with projects even as a very young unexperienced student
%
%Philipp, how to ask questions -- thank you for your patience throughout my career. A person I emailed a countless number of times about issues in the lab or things I thought were interesting. 
%
%Alex Ma, additional patience plus the power of insistence and constant reminder that everythign will be ``fine''
%
%Julian, to stay calm and enjoy physics, how to work efficiently with Markus
%
%Robert, teaching me english, trial-by-fire on when to stop thinking about a problem, and what figures are actually beautiful
%
%sooshin for showing me what was really numerically possible
%
%Joyce for your upbeat attitude and serious experience outside of academics.
%
%Daniel, that research can be fun, bike riding, dinners, board games. Thanks to you I also go to meet Renate who became a secondary postdoc I could always talk to
%
%Florian for being willing to talk to me about anything technical and help on things that weren't even for his lab. Not to mention giving me my first bike and bike pump.
%
%Sebastian, first postdoc to take me seriously and show support both with my future and my goals including discussions with Markus.
%
%Max Parsons, snarky new englander whom also gave me my first sourdough starter and was always happy to discuss some interesting physics he came across
%
%Susannah, a source of constant calm and collected decisions and help. While I never had the pleasure of working with you, the peace and order you brought to the group in general was a perk/benefit that helped everyone.
%
%Anton Mazurenko, for being a good friend and desk mate, for helping me find a job and helping me make important life deicions. For being a fellow cat owner and constant friend whetehr it was skiing, board games, or beer.
%
%Christie Chiu, somehow a special connection due to overlap in a rather large number of things - we both came from HEP, came to AMO in Markus's group at the same time and are graduating together. It has been a fun journey and I couldn't have asked for a better colleague and friend -- especially in the early years of starting in greiner lab
%
%Anne Hebert, friend and now deskmate! Endless selfless times taking care of my cat and talking to me about baking or raclette
%
%aaron, always a source of cheer and funny stories. I felt like I got to live a far more exciting life vicariously through your adventures
%
%sepher my irap friend! someone whose enthusiasm for physics i find truly laudable -- the atom array team is lucky to have you
%
%greg, a respectful deskmate and serious source of technical knowledge
%
%muqing, the food! Always showing interest in whatever new project we were starting
%
%furkan, turk abi
%
%Geoffo, help in all things statistics, coding, electronics. whatever. the only exception I know to jack of all trades and still a master of them too
%
%
%Dom, my oldest and best friend/roommate in grad school. There are any number of experiences I would have to say were made infinitely better thanks to your presence. Thank you for your support and friendship.
%
%Louis, beer bro and amo friend from down the hall. you and rachel both whether it was meeting up in spain or hanging out wherever.
%
%
%
%Melis, my unwavering supporter whose help and constant support I don't imagine I could ever deserve.
