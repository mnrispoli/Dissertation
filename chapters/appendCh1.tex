\chapter{Chapter 1 Calculations}
\label{appendix:Ch1Cal}

Starting from two propagating plane waves, we can find the shape of the potential that is proportional to the intensity:

\begin{equation}
V_{Latt} \propto |e^{i (k_l x - \omega t) } + e^{i (k_l x + \omega t)}|^2 \propto  \cos^2{\left ( k_l x \right ) } \propto \cos{\left ( 2 k_l x \right ) }
\end{equation}

Note, that we have left the potential as a function of the laser wavevector. This is important for the definition of the ``recoil energy" of the lattice. To simplify calculations, we subtract off the mean energy of the lattice such that it has an amplitude $V_o$ which we define as the lattice depth. 

\begin{equation}
V_{Latt} = \frac{-Vo}{2} \cos{\left ( 2 k_l x \right ) }
\end{equation}
