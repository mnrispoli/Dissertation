\chapter{Adding integrability back with many-body localization}

Go through the usual run around of doing anderson localization to break transport in the system, then talk about interacting systems, then many-body localization.

Split up of Sp+sn if we haven't arleady done that (which we probably will have). Then just describe what you hope to see see in the system and our plots and correlator
